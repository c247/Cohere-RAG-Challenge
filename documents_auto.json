Threads are a way to improve the performance of a program by allowing for parallel execution of tasks. Multi-threading is a technique where multiple threads are used to execute tasks in parallel, which can speed up processing and improve efficiency. The professor also talks about the differences between multi-threading and single-threaded programs, and the importance of hardware support for threads. \n\nThe professor then moves on to talk about the operating system and how it interacts with threads. The operating system is responsible for managing threads, scheduling them onto cores, and switching between them. The professor also discusses the concept of parallelism and how it can be used to improve the performance of a program. \n\nThe professor then demonstrates how to use the openmp library to create threads and runs some code to show the difference in performance between a single-threaded and multi-threaded program. The professor also talks about the importance of synchronization and how to avoid issues with race conditions. \n\nThe professor then moves on to talk about the difference between a processor and a core, and how each core can support multiple threads."

The instructor then goes over some common questions and misconceptions about threads and concurrency, and explains the role of the operating system in scheduling threads to run on the CPU. \n\nThroughout the lecture, the instructor encourages students to ask questions and engage with them, and also provides links to resources for further study. \n\nWhat is a process?\n\nA process refers to an executing program that includes an instruction stream and the storage required by the program.\n\nWhat is a thread?\n\nA thread refers to a single stream of execution within a program. A program can have many threads that execute concurrently, meaning they run at the same time. \n\nWhat is a context switch?\n\nA context switch occurs when the operating system stops executing one thread and starts executing another thread on the same CPU. \n\nWhat is an interrupt?\n\nAn interrupt is a signal to the CPU indicating an event that needs immediate attention."

After that, the professor talks about the computer architecture of MIPS and how exceptions are handled by the CPU. The CPU handles interrupts by switching into privileged mode and handling the interrupt or exception.

The child process will also need to be put onto the kernel's process table. After the child process has been set up, it will need to be executed. The parent process will need to be able to wait for the child process to finish before it can move on. Implementing this fork system call should take about a week.

Virtual memory allows a program to be larger than the amount of RAM available by temporarily transferring data from RAM to disk.

The instructor also discusses the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses, the need for extra bits in the address for addressing larger amounts of physical memory, and the use of segmentation to allow for variable-sized allocations. \n\nThe instructor then demonstrates virtual memory segmentation in action by allocating memory to two processes and mapping their virtual memory addresses to non-contiguous blocks in physical memory.

I/O instructions are special instructions that are used to tell devices what to do. Memory-mapped I/O is a way of giving devices memory addresses so that data can be transferred to and from devices and memory through the same bus. Storage is any kind of device that holds data, such as floppy disks, magnetic tapes, optical discs, and hard disk drives. Hard disk drives are a form of magnetic storage that are used in modern computers. SSDs (Solid State Drives) are a form of flash memory that is used in place of hard disk drives because they are faster and more efficient than hard disk drives, but they are more expensive. Optical discs, such as CDs and DVDs, are a form of optical storage that is used to store data. The concept of wear leveling was introduced in order to prolong the life of SSDs. Finally, persistent memory is a type of memory that keeps its data even when power is lost, and it is used to cache frequently used data from slower storage devices."

It is mentioned that Windows did not use to support virtual memory, but Mac OS did. Apple then created Mac OS X, which still contained traces of Unix. The instructor then suggests reading the assignment information and going over the links provided before starting. The main points of the lecture are to ensure that the operating system works by addressing the issues with virtual memory, fixing the kernel, and creating a core map. The instructor then suggests making sure to complete these tasks to ensure that the operating system works properly. The next steps are to detect any TLB fullness and insert new TLB entries where necessary. If there are issues with writable memory, the segment needs to be marked as read-only to ensure that the memory is functioning properly. If there are any issues with the memory management, the kernel will crash. The next steps are to fix the kernel by either exiting or killing the process and making sure that the memory is managed properly to ensure that there is no failure. If there is an issue with the memory, the process can be destroyed to ensure that there is no issue with continuing."
