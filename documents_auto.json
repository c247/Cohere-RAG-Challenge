    "snippet": "In this video, the concept of magneto statics is explained. While electrostatics deals with stationary charges, magneto statics is concerned with magnetic fields in systems where electric charges are in uniform motion. The magnetic field, symbolized as B, is introduced to study the behavior of a charge Q placed in a region with both electric and magnetic fields. It is noted that the charge Q at rest will only experience an electric force, while a moving charge will experience both an electric and a magnetic force. The Lorentz force, representing the total force on a moving charge, is outlined. The video concludes with a unit analysis, clarifying the measurement units of magnetic fields (Tesla) and magnetic flux (Weber). The relationship between these units is also discussed."

    "snippet": "The cross-product is a binary operation between two vectors in three-dimensional space. If two vectors, a and b, are perpendicular, then their cross-product is given by a cross b = |a||b|sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between them. The direction of the cross product is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors and can be determined using Fleming's left-hand or right-hand rules. Conventionally the cross product is positive in the direction of the Cartesian coordinate system's arrows, which is repeated in the cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems. Therefore, to obtain a positive cross-product in these examples, you should move in the direction of the arrows. However, to obtain a negative cross-product, you should move in the opposite direction to the arrows."

    "snippet": "Magnetism, just like electricity, has its own version of Gauss's law. In this lesson, the professor explains what Gauss's law for magnetism is and how to use it. He also outlines the signs and conventions relevant to cross products before concluding with a recap of what was covered in the lecture.\n\nIn the introduction, the lecturer reminds the class that magnets, unlike some other objects, always have a north and south pole, and that the magnetic field lines exit from the north pole and enter the south pole, which indicates that the magnetic field lines form a closed loop. This introduction leads him to state Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the surface integral of the magnetic field dotted with ds is equal to zero. He explains that ds is a vector that indicates the direction of the surface being examined, and that the surface integral is a way of calculating the flux of the magnetic field across that surface.\n\nThe professor also mentions that Gauss's law for magnetism is one of Maxwell's equations, which are a set of four laws that govern electromagnetic phenomena. He emphasizes that Gauss's law for magnetism is only applicable to classical physics and does not hold true in the quantum realm."

    "snippet": "In this video, the concept of the Biot-Savart law is introduced as a way to calculate the magnetic field created by a current-carrying wire. The law specifies the magnetic field created by a small segment of current-carrying wire. The steps needed to calculate the total magnetic field created by a wire using the Biot-Savart law are laid out. These steps include choosing a coordinate system, choosing a test point, determining the segment of current-carrying wire that is closest to the test point, and then determining the angle between the wire segment and the vector from the wire segment to the test point. The video then discusses how to use the Biot-Savart law to determine the magnetic field created by a wire. The concept of symmetry is discussed as a way to simplify calculations of the magnetic field. \n\nThe idea is that if the magnetic field has symmetry then you'll be able to determine the direction of the magnetic field based on the symmetry and this will let you reduce the number of components that you have to calculate when you do your integration. Finally, the video goes over how to solve problems related to magnetic fields using the Biot-Savart law."

    "snippet": "By modifying the biot-savart law equation, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by a moving charge. The equation can be changed to include charge density, charge displacement, and velocity. The differential elements can be rearranged to define velocity in terms of the change in charge over the length of a wire over time. This version of the biot-savart law equation is suitable for moving charges at a particular speed. By using the most suitable version of the equation for a given scenario, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by moving charges. \n\nThe biot-savart law is useful for calculating the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire. The law states that the magnetic field created by a current-carrying wire is proportional to the size of the current, the length of the wire, and the distance from the wire, and it is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the wire. The modified version of the biot-savart law equation allows us to calculate the magnetic field produced by moving charges at a certain speed by considering charge density, charge displacement, and velocity. \n\nThis equation is valuable for solving problems involving moving charges and current-carrying wires."

    "snippet": "The problem is to find the magnetic field at an arbitrary point P on the axis of a circular loop of radius a carrying a current I.\nWe draw a diagram and identify the vectors DL and R.  We note that the magnetic field DB is perpendicular to both DL and R and that the vertical and horizontal components will cancel.  This leaves only a magnetic field in the X direction.  We then use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field at P.  This leads to an integral over the length of the loop.  We perform the integral and obtain the final answer. \n\nThe magnetic field at P is given by:\nB = \u03bc0I a^2/(4\u03c0)(x^2 + a^2)^{3/2}\n\nIn words, the magnetic field is proportional to the current, the radius of the loop, and inversely proportional to the distance of the point from the center of the loop.  The magnetic field is also dependent on the angle of the point P from the axis of the loop. \n\nThis problem utilizes the Biot-Savart law and basic geometry to find a magnetic field."

    "snippet": "The calculation of the magnetic field at a point P, which is halfway through a thin, straight wire carrying a current of I, is considered. It is assumed that the magnetic field leads at point P are negated by twisting the wires. To calculate the magnetic field, the Biot-Savart Law is used, which states that the magnetic field created by a wire is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the wire. The integral of the Biot-Savart Law is then taken from -L/2 to L/2 to get the magnetic field at point P. By using known identities and simplifying the equation, the magnetic field at point P away from the axis at the midpoint of a finite wire can be determined to be mu zero IHL / 2 pi H squared square root of 4 H squared plus l squared in the Z direction."
