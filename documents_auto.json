    "snippet": "In this video, the concept of magneto statics is explained. While electrostatics deals with stationary charges, magneto statics is concerned with magnetic fields in systems where electric charges are in uniform motion. The magnetic field, magnetic flux density, or magnetic induction is represented by the letter B and is measured in Webers per meter squared (Wb/m2). If a charge, Q, is at rest, it only experiences an electric force, Fe = QE. However, if the charge is in motion, it experiences a magnetic force, FM = QuvB, in addition to the electric force. The total force experienced by the charge is F = Fe + FM, which is known as the Lorentz force. It is important to understand the equations related to these forces. The magnetic field is measured in Tesla's (T), while the magnetic flux is measured in Weber's (Wb). 1 Tesla is equal to 1 Weber per meter squared, or Newton seconds per Coulomb times meter."

    "snippet": "The cross-product is a binary operation between two vectors in three-dimensional space. If two vectors, let's say a and b, are angled at theta to each other, their cross-product is equal to the magnitude of a times b times the sine of theta. The direction of the cross product is perpendicular to the plane created by the two vectors and can be determined using Fleming's left-hand or right-hand rule. \n\nIf you are working in the Cartesian coordinate system, the cross product is positive when you move in the order of the arrows, which is from X to Y to Z. In the cylindrical coordinate system, it is positive when you move from Phi to Zed, and in the spherical coordinate system, it is positive when you move from R to theta to Phi. \n\nThere are also conventions for the sign of the cross product. In the Cartesian coordinate system, if you reverse the order of the arrows, the cross-product will be negative. Similarly, in the cylindrical coordinate system, if you move from Zed to Phi, the cross-product will be negative. In the spherical coordinate system, if you move from theta to R, the cross-product will be negative."

    "snippet": "Magnets have two poles, the North pole and the South pole, and the magnetic field lines leave the North pole and enter the South pole. This means that the magnetic field lines form closed loops, and the flux on a closed surface is zero. This is called Gauss's law for magnetism, the second of Maxwell's equations. In quantum mechanics, other identities need to be used for calculations. \n\nIs there anything else regarding Gauss's law for magnetism that you would like to know?"

    "snippet": "In this video, the Biot-Savart law is defined as the magnetic field created by an electric current. The formula for the law is given as B = \u03bc0 * I * L / (2 * pi * R), where B is the magnetic field, I is the current, L is the length of the wire, R is the distance from the wire, and \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space. Using this formula, a problem is presented where a wire with a current running through it in specified and the magnetic field created by a specified point is calculated. Then, a strategy is laid out for solving these types of problems using the Biot-Savart law. This strategy involves picking an appropriate coordinate system, defining a point and its distance from the wire, determining the direction of the magnetic field using the Fleming's left-hand rule, applying the Biot-Savart law, and checking for symmetry in the magnetic field. \n\nThis video covers the same topic as Magnetic Field from Current Carrying Wire & Biot-Savart Law, but uses different examples and explanations."

    "snippet": "The calculation of the magnetic field at a point P, which is halfway through a straight wire carrying a current of I, is considered. It is assumed that the magnetic field leads to the ends of the wire cancel out at point P. To calculate the magnetic field, the Biot-Savart law is used, which states that the magnetic field created by a wire is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the wire. The formula for the magnetic field is derived using trigonometric identities and vector analysis. The integral of the magnetic field along the axis is then calculated, resulting in the determination of the magnetic field at point P. \n\nThe key steps in the calculation involve defining the coordinates of point P and setting up the magnetic field equation using the Biot-Savart law. The integral of the magnetic field is then calculated by using known identities and simplifying the equation. The final result is the magnetic field at point P, which is a function of the current, the length of the wire, and the distance from the wire. \n\nThe calculation considers the effects of twisting the wire and assumes that the magnetic field at point P is negligible."
